Started with a repo created on github. 


Poetry installed using:

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -


created .bash_profile with the following:

grep -q $HOME/.local/bin <<< $PATH || \
cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<EOF
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
EOF


Discovered that you can't use the "new" feature that creates src/ & tests/ in an empty directory. 

Used the following to work around:


poetry new --name global-greeter --src deleteme && mv deleteme/* . && rm -rf deleteme



Enabled completions:

poetry completions bash >> ~/.bash_completion

Doesn't work because of cleo (see:  https://github.com/python-poetry/cleo/issues/133)

Fixed local version with the following:

#(word word word) -> (word\ word\ word)
sed -Ei 's/(\(\w+)(\ \w+)(\ \w+\))/\1\\\2\\\3/' ~/.bash_completion 

#(word word) -> (word\ word)
sed -Ei 's/(\(\w+)(\ \w+\))/\1\\\2/' ~/.bash_completion
